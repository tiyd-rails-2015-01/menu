## General Thoughts
AAAARGGHH CSS!  
Things I'm stuck on:  
* tried to shrink height of header a million ways; nothing worked

* can't get around the formatting of the "user agent stylesheet" on the button and dropdown on the forms

* the form formatting is pretty terrible in all directions, but passable...although I had to use break because calling margin-top or padding on that class did NOTHING

* refills provides soooo much code, I think there are unnecessary duplicates...or with some things, I compromised and changed a bigger category because I couldn't figure out how to target the smaller one.
